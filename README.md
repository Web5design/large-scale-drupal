Resources for fostering open source collaboration and community engagement.

Here's a brainstorm of the kinds of things we want to start adding to this repo:

* Doug Gaff's framework for receiving support for engaging with open source communities and open source code
* Open data resources
* Talking points about "data as an asset"
* Tactical recommendations (not just philosophical): How do I do this? What are the best practices? And how do I measure the ROI after?
