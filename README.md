Resources for fostering open source collaboration and community engagement.

Here's a brainstorm of the kinds of things we want to start adding to this repo:

* Doug Gaff's framework for receiving support for engaging with open source communities and open source code
* Open data resources
* Talking points about "data as an asset"
* Tactical recommendations (not just philosophical): How do I do this? What are the best practices? And how do I measure the ROI after?
* Popular myths & facts about open data and open source (e.g. security, selling data, "free" / costs)
* Tips for navigating open source licenses
* Reframing: Contribution and giving back versus participation
* Benefits of releasing/participating early and often; subjecting yourself to that process
* Advantages to having your team adhere to their open source project's best practices and standards
* Wins / white papers / case studies about people who have done these an succeeded (BART?)
* When is it in my best interest to open source code? When should I not open source it?
* "Preparing for sharing" (e.g. you have to build things that are sharable)
* If you build it doesn't mean they will come
